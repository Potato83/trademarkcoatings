						Trademark Coatings offers a variety of high performance flooring options for facility managers, property owners and specifiers looking for an ultra durable, easy to maintain, seamless flooring system. Often times the right choice depends on the facility environment and what performance characteristics are required in the floor coatings.
					</p>
					<p>
						These floors are a great value for medium to high impact areas where heavy traffic is expected.  Industrial Floor Coatings are available in almost any colour and can be applied in various thicknesses from 1/32" to 1".  They can dramaticaly improve the aesthetics and harden the surface of existing concrete substrates. Epoxies create seamless, waterproof barriers, which provide a well-protected surface. Urethanes will exceed most customers' specifications for durability and are a performer in high abrasion areas or areas exposed to thermal shock.

						With more homes being built on concrete slabs and home owners finishing basements into living spaces, we are now able to transform the very concrete itself and turn it into an extremely durable, moisture/mold/chemical resistant floor. Imagine a floor that is so durable it can withstand vehicular traffic. A floor that dosen't stain like tile grout or carpeting. A floor that dosen't easily scratch like hardwood. Those are just a few benefits that our flooring systems bring to your home.

						One of a kind transformations... each floor is its own unique piece of art.  Concrete flooring options are endless.  Choose from different patterns, textures, colors, designs and more.
